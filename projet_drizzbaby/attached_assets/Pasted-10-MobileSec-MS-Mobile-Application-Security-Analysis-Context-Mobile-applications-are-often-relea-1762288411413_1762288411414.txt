10) MobileSec-MS — Mobile Application Security Analysis
Context

Mobile applications are often released with serious vulnerabilities such as exposed API keys, poor local storage management, lack of encryption, or missing client-side validation. Manual security testing is time-consuming and costly, and existing tools are not always suited for continuous DevSecOps pipelines.
A modular platform could automatically detect these issues through static or dynamic analysis.

Objective

Develop a modular platform composed of specialized microservices that enable:

Automated analysis of mobile application packages (APK/IPA),

Detection of OWASP MAS (Mobile Application Security) vulnerabilities,

Extraction of missing best practices (SSL security, permissions, export configurations, storage),

Suggestion of corrective actions,

Continuous integration within DevSecOps workflows.

Detailed Microservice Architecture
1. APKScanner

Role: Disassembles and analyzes APKs to extract the manifest, permissions, and endpoints.

Technologies: Python (Androguard, Apktool), SQLite database for metadata.

Function: Identifies exported components, dangerous permissions, debuggable flags, allowBackup, cleartextTrafficPermitted, etc.

2. SecretHunter

Role: Searches for exposed secrets within the source code or resources.

Technologies: GitLeaks, custom Regex, YARA Rules.

Function: Detects API keys, OAuth tokens, hardcoded passwords, and other sensitive data.

3. CryptoCheck

Role: Verifies the correct use of cryptographic APIs.

Technologies: SAST for Java/Kotlin, rule-based detection (CWE).

Function: Detects insecure practices such as AES/ECB usage, missing padding, weak random generation, or MD5/SHA1 hashing.

4. NetworkInspector

Role: Intercepts and analyzes network communications through a MITM proxy.

Technologies: mitmproxy, Docker sandbox with Android AVD.

Function: Examines HTTPS/TLS configurations, HTTP headers, certificate handling, and potential data leaks.

5. ReportGen

Role: Aggregates all scan results and generates detailed reports (PDF, JSON, SARIF).

Technologies: Node.js, Puppeteer.

Function: Produces a complete summary of detected vulnerabilities and corresponding remediation recommendations.

6. FixSuggest

Role: Provides suggested patches or configurations to apply.

Technologies: MASVS rule model → YAML → patch generator.

Function: Suggests concrete actions such as android:exported="false", enabling Proguard, or isolating signingConfig.

7. CIConnector

Role: Ensures integration with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.

Technologies: Docker CLI, YAML plugins.

Function: Triggers automated scans at each build or deployment step.

Expected Results

Fast and automated detection of mobile security vulnerabilities.

Compliance support with OWASP MASVS, CWE, and CIS Mobile standards.

Smooth integration into Android/iOS DevSecOps cycles.

Extensible open-source platform, including sample datasets and reproducible reports for publication in SoftwareX.
